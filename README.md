# full-stack-developer-portfolio-arriaza
A website to showcase my talents as a developer and how to get in touch with me.

Estimated time to code: 6 hours

Things I have learned while coding:
* CSS animations
** anything is animatable (sp?) 
** on hover or through JS change a prop and induce animation
* HTML, body scroll on click
* element.offsetposition
** an effort to use more vanilla JS and less jQuery
