# My Full Stack Developer Portfolio
[bit.ly/peter-arriaza](http://bit.ly/peter-arriaza)

A website to showcase my talents as a developer and how to get in touch with me.  

Contains links to my projects and live demos if available.  



Things I have learned while coding this:
* CSS animations
    * anything is animatable (sp?) 
    * on hover or through JS change a prop and induce animation
* HTML, body scroll on click
* element.offsetposition
    * an effort to use more vanilla JS and less jQuery
* how to create pop-up modals
